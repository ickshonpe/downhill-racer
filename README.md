Downhill Racer game in Rust
  
They had an example game called Downhill Racer in the first programming book I read years ago. 
The orginal wasn't a good game but it was like seven lines of BASIC. This version is more modern but still rubbish.

Performance is horrible. 
No experience with Rust, and its not like I read Piston's documentation or anything so as expected I guess.
There is like a file called gl_version.rs that I think was meant to have hardware accelerated skiing graphics but I think
I got bored and gave up before it got anywhere and then I forgot everything that I was doing.
